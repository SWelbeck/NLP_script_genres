Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends          of the facility          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and          louder like a boiling pot of water The Tesseract's energy          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge which HITS          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device The          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy The beam then          forms a VORTEX which then opens up a PORTAL          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED From the portal the blackness of          SPACE beautiful and mysterious

top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling It's abnormally          quiet Then HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach weapons in hands A figure is          kneeling on the platform smoke coming off it It's LOKI          Smiling in his mischievous manner he raises his head The smile          dies down He looks deep into the eyes of Fury Barton and

shot at Loki but the          bullets bounce off him like a boss Loki jumps high from the          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him          In the blink of an eye Loki takes down several guards with his          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter He stops and waits to          see who will attack him next Honestly the whole lab has almost          gone to shit          Barton tries to stand up Loki quickly walks towards him Barton          raises his gun but Loki grabs Barton's hand                          LOKI           You have heart          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head Barton's          eyes suddenly glow BLACK The ability to control Barton's mind          is now in Loki's hand Barton puts his piece away and stands          straight          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of          several SHIELD personnel Fury takes the Tesseract          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the labThen

end NICK FURY At this end CLINT BARTON Yeah the cube is a doorway to the other end of space right The doors open from both sides DR SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares Suddenly the Tesseract THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility Big enough where both Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends of the facility The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and louder like a boiling pot of water The Tesseract's energy builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge which HITS at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device The great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy The beam then forms a VORTEX which then opens up a PORTAL A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED From the portal the blackness of SPACE beautiful and mysterious strewn with a billion stars appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room blinding everyone The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling It's abnormally quiet Then HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach weapons in hands A figure is kneeling on the platform smoke coming off it It's LOKI Smiling in his mischievous manner he raises his head The smile dies down He looks deep into the eyes of Fury Barton and Selvig He stands up holing the scepter NICK FURY Sir please put down the spear Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot ALL HELL BREAKS Machine gun fire is shot at Loki but the bullets bounce off him like a boss Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him In the blink of an eye Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter He stops and waits to see who will attack him next Honestly the whole lab has almost gone to shit Barton tries to stand up Loki quickly walks towards him Barton raises his gun but Loki grabs Barton's hand LOKI You have heart Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK The ability to control Barton's mind is now in Loki's hand Barton puts his piece away and stands straight As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several SHIELD personnel Fury takes the Tesseract placing it back into its case and tries to leave the labThen LOKI Please don't I still need that NICK FURY TURNING This doesn't have to get any messier LOKI Of course it does I've come too far for anything else I am Loki of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose SELVIG Loki Brother of Thor NICK FURY We have no quarrel with your people LOKI An ant has no quarrel with a boot NICK FURY You planning to step on us LOKI I come with glad tidings of a world made free NICK FURY Free from what LOKI Freedom Freedom is life's great lie Once you accept that in your heart Like a gunslinger Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart Selvig's eyes glow BLACK LOKI You will know peace NICK FURY Yeah you say peace I kind of think you mean the other thing From the vacuum chamber ceiling Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion CLINT BARTON Sir Director Fury is stalling This place is about to blow Drop a hundred feet of rock on us He means to bury us NICK FURY Like The Pharaohs of Odin SELVIG He's right The portal is collapsing in on itself You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical

suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave as she's walking away NICK FURY through the walkie talkie Hill do you copy Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill BACK AT THE LAB Fury is sitting up pulling out the bullet breathing heavily NICK FURY Barton is INT PEGASUS BUNKER NIGHT Suddenly Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON but Barton is already POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING he moves the driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps shooting BACK AT THE LAB Fury is holding his side running NICK FURY He's got the Tesseract Track it down The energy is

roar out after them Agent Hill puts herself at a distance INT FACILITY FLOOR NIGHT Fury races out of the hallway avoiding falling pipes The entire facility is now in a full earthquake INT FACILITY

which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and put her back behind INT RADIATION FACILITY VACUUM CHAMBER NIGHT The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF WHITE LIGHT Then A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF THE DESERT Fury watches from below a RAPID buildup into what may be an implosion Several miles away Agent Coulson's van feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE THE ENTIRE FACILITY SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF A TERRIFYING UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION INT PEGASUS TUNNEL NIGHT The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it Like an ocean wave blinding crumbles of falling rock fall onto Agent Hill's JEEP leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket of rock On the Barton's truck they escape the tunnel and drive into the desert landscape Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck Loki looks up From the chopper's door it slides open and Fury stands there holding a gun SHOOTING at Barton's giving an honoring image of JULES WINNFIELD Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE points his scepter SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT The chopper CATCHES on fire GOING DOWN in a FIERY BALL Fury like the boss he is JUMPS OUT and touches
