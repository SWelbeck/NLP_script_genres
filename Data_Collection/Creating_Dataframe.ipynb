The\\n        skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some\\n        unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.\\n        Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten\\n        million dead souls.

Searchlights blaze down as a\\n        formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes\\n        overhead.

BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT\\n\\n        THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for\\n        possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla\\n        army.  Skynet\\'s weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot\\n        gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called\\n        Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.\\n\\n        SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:\\n5A      Explosions!

Another (complete cyborg),\\n        with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the\\n        ground.\\n\\n5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut\\n        down as they run.  Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing\\n        machines.\\n\\n6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches\\n        the combat with night-vision binoculars.

MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.  He lowers the\\n        binoculars.  He is forty-five years old.  Features severe.  The left\\n        side of his face is heavily scarred.  A patch covers that eye.  An\\n        impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name\\n        stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.  We push in until his\\n        eyes fill frame, then...\\n\\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n        FIRE.  SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.

As before, the\\n                Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A\\n                protector for John.

TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT\\n\\n        Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon\\n        formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot\\n        of an all-night truck stop.  Then...\\n\\n        The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in\\n        the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.\\n        Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!\\n\\n        Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.\\n        TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:\\n        devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its\\n        surroundings.\\n\\n8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT\\n\\n        On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over\\n        chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are\\n        playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the\\n        table\\'s rail.  The dive\\'s owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a\\n        soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...\\n\\n        Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that\\n        doesn\\'t happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward\\n        Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it\\n        walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to\\n        react.\\n\\n8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid\\n        with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye\\n        can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the\\n        owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking\\n        biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or \"selected\", and\\n        thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been\\n        analyzed and deemed suitable...\\n\\n8B                              TERMINATOR\\n                I need your clothes, your boots, and your\\n                motorcycle.\\n\\n        The big biker\\'s eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,\\n        the tip cherry-red hot.\\n\\n                                CIGAR BIKER\\n                You forgot to say please.\\n\\n        He grinds the cigar out on Terminator\\'s chest.  Which produces not\\n        the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without\\n        expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...\\n        Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.\\n\\n        Terminator doesn\\'t see Cigar\\'s friend, behind him, holding his pool\\n        cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send\\n        whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of\\n        Terminator\\'s head.\\n\\n        Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn\\'t even blink.  Without\\n        releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs\\n        Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker\\n        finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!\\n\\n        Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,\\n        through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the\\n        big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar\\n        screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.\\n\\n        The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes\\n        at Terminator\\'s face.\\n\\n        Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by\\n        the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy\\'s hand.\\n        Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you\\'re supposed\\n        to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the\\n        bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker\\'s\\n        shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.\\n\\n9       INT. KITCHEN\\n\\n        The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.\\n        The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,\\n        who is cursing in pain on the floor.\\n\\n        With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto\\n        tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can\\'t even hold onto it.\\n        Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,\\n        Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and\\n        operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that\\'s a human\\n        thing.  He just takes.\\n\\n        Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to\\n        him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator\\'s\\n        foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.\\n\\n10      INT. TRUCK STOP\\n\\n        Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black\\n        leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He\\n        moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without\\n        slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the\\n        floor, groaning, behind him.\\n\\n        Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,\\n        the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit\\n        frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally\\n        nods.\\n\\n                                TRUCKER\\n                Evening...\\n\\n        Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.\\n\\n11      EXT. TRUCK STOP\\n\\n        Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45\\n        in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.\\n        He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks\\n        over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron\\n        into gear with a KLUNK.\\n\\n        Lloyd appears at the diner\\'s door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE\\n        WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks\\n        around round in fast, aiming at Terminator\\'s back.\\n\\n                                LLOYD\\n                I can\\'t let you take the man\\'s wheels, son.\\n                Now get off or I\\'ll put you down.\\n\\n        Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up\\n        into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg\\n        over and walks calmly toward the guy.\\n\\n        Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the\\n        shotgun\\'s muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he\\'s\\n        going to kill a man in cold blood.  He\\'s still trying to decide when\\n        Terminator\\'s hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow\\n        suddenly holding the shotgun.\\n\\n        Lloyd gapes, knowing he\\'s screwed.  Then...\\n        Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...\\n        And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd\\'s shirt pocket.  Puts them on.\\n        Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.\\n\\n12      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares\\n        across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through\\n        the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.  The lights flow\\n        over Terminator\\'s wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer\\n        rounds.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n13      EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT\\n\\n        The First Street Bridge.  Rusting chain-link fence and graffiti-\\n        covered walls.  An L.A.P.D. BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.\\n\\n        A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns\\n        of the overpass.  The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head\\n        around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time\\n        to see...\\n\\n13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between\\n        the columns.  Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light\\n        standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting\\n        whirlwind.\\n\\n13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.\\n        He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the\\n        strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the\\n        shadows between the rows of pillars.\\n\\n        A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing\\n        special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash\\n        of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he\\n        just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering\\n        on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.\\n\\n        THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The\\n        blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.\\n\\n        LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm\\n        AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.  A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up\\n        this pistol.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n13C     HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the police\\n        cruiser.  FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruiser\\'s door then MOVE UP as\\n        Mr. X, dressed now in LAPD blue, climbs behind the wheel.  He\\n        looks and acts exactly like a cop.  Cool, alert, confident in his\\n        power, his expression emotionless and judgmental.\\n        Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n14      INT.

He has\\n        ripped Levi\\'s and long stringy hair.  A sullen mouth.  Eyes which\\n        reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel.

He stops\\n        at a row of bikes near the escalators.  John\\'s little Honda sits\\n        proudly with the big street bikes.  Terminator parks.\\n\\n43      INT. GALLERIA\\n\\n        OFFICER X is moving through the flow of shoppers.  The place is a zoo.\\n        He stops some kids and shows them the picture.  They shrug.\\n\\n43A     IN A CROWDED VIDEO ARCADE JOHN is lost in an intense battle, going for\\n        a new high score at \"Missile Command\".  He parries deftly at the enemy\\n        ICBMs deploy their MIRVs... the warheads stream down... it\\'s more than\\n        he can deal with.  The world gets nuked.  Game over.  He slouches\\n        away from the game, looking for another.  Bored.\\n\\n        RACK FOCUS to Officer X passing the entrance of the store behind him.\\n        The cop moves on, down the concourse, out of sight.\\n        John gets in an \"Afterburner\" simulator game.\\n\\n43B     ON TERMINATOR, walking through the crowd in slow motion.  Scanning.\\n        He moves with methodical purpose, knowing the target is close.  We\\n        see that he is, incredibly, carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES.  Like\\n        some hopeful guy with a hot date.\\n\\n43C     THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the\\n        multi-cinema.  He walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized\\n        combat.  Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise.\\n\\n43D     JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2.  His friend Tim slides up next\\n        to him.  Taps him on the shoulder, trying to play it cool.\\n\\n                                TIM\\n                Some cop is scoping for you, dude.\\n\\n        John looks around the corner of the \"Afterburner\" ride.  Sees the cop\\n        showing a picture to some of the kids.  The kids point his way.\\n\\n        John ducks just as the cop glances over.  He slinks out the other side\\n        of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively\\n        retreating.  Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news.\\n\\n        THE COP scans the crowded arcade.  Glimpses John, looking back as he\\n        moves around a row of machines.  Starts toward him.\\n\\n        JOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast.  Looks back.\\n        THE COP is shoving through clots of kids.  One of them is slammed to\\n        the floor.  As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed.\\n        John breaks into run.  So does the cop.\\n        Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John.\\n        John sprints through the arcade\\'s back officer and store-rooms.\\n\\n44      INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR\\n\\n        John emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects\\n        to the parking garage.  He\\'s running full out, when around the corner\\n        ahead of him comes...\\n\\n        TERMINATOR.  Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to\\n        brake to a stop.  Terminator reaches into the box of roses.\\n\\n        SLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box\\n        falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR\\'S BOOT\\n        crushes the flowers as it moves forward.\\n\\n        JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless\\n        shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator\\n        expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber,\\n        slow and fluid.\\n\\n        John looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward\\n        him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop\\n        is aiming his gun at him!\\n        John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle\\n        of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he\\'s\\n        screwed.  Then something crazy happens...\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Get down.\\n\\n        John instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM!\\n\\n        THE COP catches the SHOTGUN\\'S BLAST square in the chest just as he\\n        fires the pistol.  The pistol\\'s shot goes wild.\\n\\n        TERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another.\\n        Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the\\n        cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING.\\n        Then silence.\\n\\n        THE COP lies still on his back.\\n\\n44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the\\n        cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator\\n        grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest\\n        then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta.\\n\\n44B     The \"cop\", who not only isn\\'t a cop, he clearly isn\\'t even human,\\n        pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.\\n\\n        ON TERMINATOR\\'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody\\n        holes in the motorcycle jacket.\\n\\n        JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator\\'s\\n        body has blocked the bullets.\\n\\n        The Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound.\\n        Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts\\n        walking toward the \"cop\".\\n        The empty magazine clatters to the floor.\\n        The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide.\\n        Terminator still has twenty feet to go.\\n        He doesn\\'t break his purposeful stride.\\n\\n        The cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator\\'s chest.  He doesn\\'t\\n        even flinch.\\n        Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator\\n        show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator\\'s\\n        wardrobe to shreds.\\n\\n        CLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front\\n        of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second.\\n\\n        We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don\\'t know the\\n        details yet, but let\\'s call him the T-1000 (since that\\'s what he is).\\n        A newer model than the one we\\'ve come to know so well (the 800\\n        Series \"Arnold\").  This guy\\'s a prototype... and he\\'s got quite a\\n        few surprises.\\n\\n        T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first.\\n        He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a\\n        counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls\\n        on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and\\n        the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and\\n        disappeared.\\n\\n        JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to\\n        his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.\\n\\n44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator\\n        crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the\\n        screaming crowd.\\n\\n44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after\\n        John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.\\n\\n44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps\\n        forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator\\'s\\n        eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away.\\n\\n        He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to\\n        his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist\\'s camera\\n        whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.\\n        The owner isn\\'t even looking through the eyepiece, he\\'s so shocked.\\n\\n45      INT. PARKING GARAGE\\n\\n        John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared\\n        shitless and the damned thing won\\'t start.  His hands are shaking so\\n        badly he can\\'t find the choke.  He looks up to see --\\n        The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.\\n        John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear\\n        and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.\\n\\n        John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the\\n        throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000\\n        is gaining.  This nightmare isn\\'t happening.  John races out the exit\\n        ramp, and charges right into the street.\\n\\n46      EXT. STREET\\n\\n        John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.\\n        The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn\\'t see\\n        is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who\\n        emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.\\n\\n46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his\\n        door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and\\n        takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.\\n        T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him,\\n        up ahead, weaving through traffic.\\n\\n46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the\\n        Harley.\\n        He accelerates after the others.\\n\\n47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL\\n\\n        John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he\\'s ever done\\n        it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a\\n        narrower tributary which has vertical sides.\\n\\n        He looks back.  No sign of pursuit.\\n47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.\\n        The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring\\n        diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right\\n        into the center of the canal.\\n\\n        It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an\\n        angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of\\n        metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing\\n        like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering\\n        speed.\\n\\n47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow\\n        concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike\\n        has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train\\n        in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,\\n        backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And...\\n        it\\'s gaining.\\n\\n47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is\\n        fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow-\\n        truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet\\n        behind him and still gaining.\\n\\n47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall\\n        of metal filling frame behind him.\\n\\n47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the\\n        road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into\\n        the air like Steve McQueen in \"The Great Escape\" and vaults the fence\\n        bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears\\n        along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the\\n        truck in the canal below.\\n\\n47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The\\n        massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back\\n        fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at\\n        about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike.\\n\\n47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700-\\n        pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs\\n        down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms\\n        out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast\\n        reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights\\n        for control.\\n\\n47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John\\'s tiny\\n        Honda.\\n        Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him\\n        onto the Harley, in front of him.  John\\'s Honda weaves and falls,\\n        smashing instantly under thundering tires.\\n\\n        The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and\\n        supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two\\n        channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially\\n        a short tunnel.\\n\\n47I     The truck can\\'t fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that\\n        speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into\\n        the concrete abutment at seventy.\\n\\n47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a\\n        fireball blasting through behind them as the truck\\'s side-tanks\\n        explode.\\n\\n        Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the\\n        destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in\\n        the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,\\n        disappearing around a bend.\\n\\n47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.\\n        Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of\\n        flame.  A figure appears in the fire.\\n        Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly.\\n        The figure emerges from the flames.\\n\\n        It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a\\n        servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex\\n        hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome\\n        surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It\\n        reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.\\n        Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.\\n\\n        With each step detail returns.\\n        First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid\\n        chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,\\n        ears...\\n\\n47K     But it\\'s still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to\\n        everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,\\n        mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around.\\n\\n        It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine\\n        with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.\\n\\n47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.\\n        T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000\\n        blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of\\n        violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so\\n        perfect.\\n        It walks among the other cops unnoticed.\\n        Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away.\\n\\n48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the\\n        empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the\\n        person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent\\n        of father/son, out for an evening ride.\\n\\n        John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and\\n        he\\'s just a ten-year kid, but he\\'s also John Connor who will someday\\n        rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!\\n\\n        Terminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn.\\n        They head into a nearby alley.\\n\\n49      EXT. ALLEY\\n\\n        Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John\\n        slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John\\n        checks him out.  Tentatively speaks.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Now don\\'t take this the wrong way, but you are\\n                a terminator, right?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                No way!\\n\\n        John touches Terminator\\'s skin.  Then the blood on his jacket.\\n        His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Holy shit... you\\'re really real!  I mean...\\n                whoah!\\n                        (stepping back)\\n                You\\'re, uh... like a machine underneath, right...\\n                but sort of alive outside?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                I\\'m a cybernetic organism.

Okay, uh...\\n                you\\'re not here to kill me... I figured that part\\n                out for myself.  So what\\'s the deal?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                My mission is to protect you.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Yeah?  Who sent you?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed\\n                me to be your protector here, in this time.\\n\\n        John gives him an amazed look.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                This is deep.\\n\\n50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n        John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side\\n        streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness,\\n        Terminator\\'s wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up\\n        and back.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                So this other guy?

VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\\n\\n        Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her\\n        shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.\\n        She answers sweetly.\\n\\n                                JANELLE\\n                Hello?\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                        (filtered through phone)\\n                Janelle?  It\\'s me.\\n\\n        In the backyard, John\\'s German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at\\n        something.\\n\\n                                JANELLE\\n                John?  Where are you, honey?  It\\'s late.  You\\n                should come home, dear.  I\\'m making a casserole.\\n\\n        AT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers\\n        the phone\\'s mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                        (whispering)\\n                Something\\'s wrong.  She\\'s never this nice.\\n\\n        IN THE VOIGHTS\\' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen\\'s back door.\\n        Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs\\n        a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog\\'s barking.\\n\\n                                TODD\\n                What the hell\\'s the goddamn dog barking at?\\n                SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!\\n\\n        TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.  He\\n        passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.  Janelle switches the phone to her\\n        other hand then... THUNK!  Her free hand seems to do something out of\\n        frame.  There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto\\n        the floor. (Don\\'t go away.  We\\'ll find out what happened in a moment)\\n\\n        AT THE PAYPHONE\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                The dog\\'s really barking.  Maybe it\\'s already\\n                there.  What should I do?\\n\\n        Terminator takes the phone from John\\'s hand.  Janelle\\'s voice is\\n        floating through the receiver.\\n\\n                                JANELLE\\n                        (filtered)\\n                John?

Let\\'s go.\\n\\n        Terminator heads for the bike.  John, shocked, stares after him.\\n\\n53      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN\\n\\n        Janelle hangs up the phone.  Her expression is neutral.  Calm.\\n\\n        PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the\\n        shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into\\n        something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like\\n        spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the\\n        spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth\\n        and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are\\n        glassy and lifeless.\\n\\n        The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually\\n        standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.  THUMP.\\n53A     Janelle doesn\\'t bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and\\n        color, transforming back into a hand, and then...\\n\\n53B     JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000.  The\\n        change has liquid quality.  T-1000 opens the back door.\\n\\n54      EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT\\n\\n        T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,\\n        barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT\\n        OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.\\n        Then T-1000\\'s hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.\\n        The tag reads \"MAX\".\\n        T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house.\\n\\n55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\n        Dark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley,\\n        watching John pace before him.  John\\'s brain is calling time-out.\\n        This is all too weird.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                I need a minute here, okay?  You\\'re telling me\\n                it can imitate anything it touches?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Anything it samples by physical contact.\\n\\n        John thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent\\'s parameters.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Like it could disguise itself as anything...\\n                a pack of cigarettes?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                No.  Only an object of equal size.\\n\\n        John\\'s still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems\\n        downright conventional next to the exotic new model.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Well, why doesn\\'t become a bomb or something to\\n                get me?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                It can\\'t form complex machines.  Guns and\\n                explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It\\n                doesn\\'t work that way.  But it can form solid\\n                metal shapes.\\n\\n56      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\n        T-1000 walks down the dark hall.  It passes the bathroom and we see\\n        the real Janelle\\'s legs through the half-open door.  The shower is\\n        running.  Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.\\n\\n56A     In John\\'s bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the\\n        dark.\\n        Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that\\n        could lead it to its target.  T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes\\n        marked \"Messages from Mom\".  In it are some letters, and envelopes\\n        filled with snapshots.  It begins looking through some of the\\n        photos...\\n\\n        SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.  Sarah in olive\\n        cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim.\\n        Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to\\n        cases of Stinger missiles.  John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in\\n        the mountains.\\n\\n57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\n        John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.  Terminator\\n        stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.  He glances\\n        down at John.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places\\n                like that.  For a while she was with this crazy\\n                ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there\\n                were some other guys.  She\\'d shack up with\\n                anybody she could learn from.  So then she\\n                could teach me how to be this great military\\n                leader.  Then she gets busted and it\\'s like...\\n                sorry kid, your mom\\'s a psycho.  Didn\\'t you\\n                know?  It\\'s like... everything I\\'d been brought\\n                up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?\\n                I hated her for that.\\n                        (he looks up)\\n                But everything she said was true.\\n                        (he stands)\\n                We gotta get her out of there.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Negative.  The T-1000\\'s highest probability for\\n                success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and\\n                wait for you to make contact with her.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Oh, great.  And what happens to her?\\n\\n        Terminator\\'s reply is matter-of-fact.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Typically, the subject being copied is\\n                terminated.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n                We gotta right now!\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Negative.  She is not a mission priority.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Yeah, well fuck you, she\\'s a priority to me!\\n\\n        John strides away.  Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm.\\n        John struggles against the grip.  Which doesn\\'t do him much good.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Hey, goddammit!  What\\'s your problem?\\n\\n        Starts dragging John back to the bike.  John spots a couple of\\n        collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts\\n        yelling to them.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Help!  HELP!!  I\\'m being kidnapped!  Get this\\n                psycho off of me!\\n\\n        The TWO JOCKS start toward him.  John yells in outrage to Terminator.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Let go of me!!\\n\\n        To his surprise, Terminator\\'s hand opens so fast John falls right on\\n        his butt.\\n        He looks up at the open hand.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Oww!  Why\\'d you do that?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                You told me to.\\n\\n        John stares at him in amazement as he realizes...\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                You have to do what I say?!\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                That is one of my mission parameters.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Prove it... stand on one foot.\\n\\n        Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.\\n        John grins.  He\\'s the first on his block...\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great!\\n\\n        The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly\\n        with one leg up in the air.  This big guy in black leather and dark\\n        glasses, standing like a statue.\\n\\n                                FIRST JOCK\\n                Hey, kid.  You okay?\\n\\n        John turns to him.  No longer needing to be rescued.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Take a hike, bozo.\\n\\n                                FIRST JOCK\\n                Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Dipshit?

The guy\\'s friend jumps behind\\n        Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --\\n        Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --\\n        Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and\\n        aims the muzzle at the guy\\'s forehead.\\n        John grabs Terminator\\'s arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger --\\n        John\\'s weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.  The\\n        guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares,\\n        shocked.  Pissing himself.  John is freaking out, too.\\n        He screams at Terminator.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Put the gun down!  NOW!!\\n\\n        Terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk.  John scoops it up fast then\\n        turns to the shocked civilians, who can\\'t believe what just happened.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Walk away.\\n\\n        They do.  Fast.  John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward\\n        the bike.  John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Of course.  I\\'m a terminator.\\n\\n        John stares at him.  Having your own terminator just became a little\\n        bit less fun to him.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You\\'re not\\n                a terminator any more.  Alright?

Trust me on this.\\n\\n        Terminator doesn\\'t get it.  John just stares at him.  Frightened at\\n        what just almost happened.  He gets a glimpse of the responsibility\\n        that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,\\n        who puts it away.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Look, I\\'m gonna go get my mom.

We see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the emergency\\n        lights of a burning corridor.\\n\\n        A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor.  The guy has\\n        short-cropped hair and dark glasses.

She\\n        goes to the counter and leans out to see if he\\'s at the drinking\\n        fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long\\n        corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird.\\n\\n66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and\\n        Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard.\\n        The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the\\n        night desk.

Silberman goes back into the secure area of\\n        the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main\\n        doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and\\n        the guard locks the door behind them.\\n\\n66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is\\n        dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary.\\n        His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle.\\n\\n66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard\\'s feet pass through FRAME.  An instant\\n        later the floor starts to move.\\n        It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the\\n        two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a\\n        quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.\\n\\n66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working.\\n        The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip.\\n        Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to\\n        resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture\\n        of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.\\n\\n        T-1000\\'s mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over\\n        several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and\\n        his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and\\n        pulling up to form the figure of the guard.\\n\\n        The T-1000/Guard\\'s feet are the last to form, the last of the \"liquid\\n        floor\" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach\\n        with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard\\n        takes its first step.\\n\\n66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.\\n        He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of\\n        that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and,\\n        inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real\\n        guard\\'s face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger\\n        spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a\\n        stiletto, slamming into the guard\\'s eye.\\n        It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans-\\n        orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard\\'s skull.\\n\\n        Life quietly empties from the guard\\'s face.  He is dead weight,\\n        hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the\\n        guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and\\n        walks him, like it\\'s carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the\\n        night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.\\n\\n66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,\\n        dragging something casually which she can\\'t see because it\\'s below\\n        the countertop.\\n\\n                                NIGHT NURSE\\n                Whatcha got, Lewis?\\n\\n                                T-1000/GUARD\\n                Just some trash.\\n\\n        She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging\\n        the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night\\n        receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power\\n        pistol and the keys from the real guard\\'s belt, then stuffs the body\\n        into the utility closet.\\n\\n66G     INT.

Instead of\\n        setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own\\n        chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of\\n        hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface\\n        that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You\\'d ever guess it was\\n        really an intelligent liquid metal.\\n\\n        T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button\\n        unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.

She faces both of them.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                Down on the floor!  Now!\\n\\n        They comply.  She comes through with Silberman, giving them a wide\\n        berth.  Starts backing down the hall away from them, still holding\\n        her hostage.  She\\'s actually pulling this off.\\n\\n71B     ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER.  What we can see, but she can\\'t see, it a\\n        third orderly waiting just around the corner.  He\\'s poised, ready to\\n        jump her when she comes abreast of him.\\n\\n        ON SARAH backing up.  She reaches the corner.\\n        The third attendant lunges, grabbing her syringe-hand.\\n        Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the\\n        nightstick.  He loses interest fast, dropping to his knees and\\n        gagging.  Silberman pulls away, screaming at the top of his lungs\\n\\n                                SILBERMAN\\n                Get her!\\n\\n        They scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the corner.\\n        One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound.\\n\\n72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned\\n        attendant inside the nurses\\' station when the alarms shriek through\\n        the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol.\\n        Heads for the security entrance.\\n\\n73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies\\n        past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies\\n        charge after her.\\n        She\\'s like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off\\n        the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door.\\n        Tries it.  Locked.\\n        Footsteps like a drum solo behind her.\\n\\n        She fumbles with Douglas\\' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in.\\n        The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt.\\n        Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it.\\n        She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch\\n        on the other side.  He\\'s too late.\\n\\n        Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys.\\n\\n73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred\\n        door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond.\\n        She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door.\\n        She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of\\n        the one she just came through being unlocked.\\n\\n        She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first\\n        orderly comes through behind her.\\n        She slams the bars shut.  CLANG.\\n        Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her.\\n        The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage.\\n\\n        She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully\\n        snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams\\n        against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances\\n        back just out of reach.\\n        He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.\\n\\n        Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies.\\n        They\\'re shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the\\n        lock --\\n        The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in.\\n        Silberman shouts at them.\\n\\n                                SILBERMAN\\n                Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!!\\n\\n        The orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor\\n        to another set of doors.\\n\\n73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead.\\n        Now she\\'s home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she\\'s nearly there when\\n        the elevator doors part...\\n\\n        TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her.\\n        Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares.\\n        Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward.\\n        Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor,\\n        staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.\\n\\n        She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity.\\n        She\\'s not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be\\n        screaming if she could get the breath to do it.\\n        In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a\\n        crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.\\n\\n        She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she\\n        would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind\\n        Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and\\n        figures out instantly what happened.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom!!  Wait!\\n\\n        Sarah doesn\\'t hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare.\\n        They take off running after Sarah.\\n\\n73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she\\n        reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure\\n        blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle.\\n        She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two\\n        orderlies leap into the fray.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it\\'s gonna kill us\\n                all!!!\\n\\n        She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is\\n        coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don\\'t even look\\n        where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.\\n\\n        They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her.\\n        Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of\\n        trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of\\n        Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare.\\n        She screams in utter hopelessness.\\n\\n        Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs\\n        one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound\\n        guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the\\n        floor.\\n        The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder.\\n        Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys.\\n        Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are\\n        flung outward like they stepped on a land mine.\\n        One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a\\n        two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an\\n        office door, splintering it into kindling.\\n\\n        Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin\\n        at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his\\n        feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless\\n        face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn\\'t human.\\n        He feels the fabric of reality crumbling.\\n        Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him,\\n        then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a\\n        second.\\n\\n        Sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her.\\n        John kneels next to her.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom, are you okay?\\n\\n        She looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator.\\n        Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad?\\n\\n        Incredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering\\n        to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Come with me if you want to live.\\n\\n        The orderlies are stirring.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                It\\'s all right, Mom.  He\\'s here to help.\\n\\n        Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers.\\n        Terminator lifts her to her feet.\\n\\n73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the\\n        walls of bars.  John doesn\\'t know what we know, but he knows\\n        something\\'s not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow\\n        John\\'s gaze.\\n        The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side.\\n        Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up.\\n\\n73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn\\'t stop.\\n        Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself\\n        through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our\\n        side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste\\n        forced past an obstacle.\\n        Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.\\n        That faint snapping sound is his mind.\\n        There is a CLANK and we see that the guard\\'s gun has caught against\\n        the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and\\n        tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.\\n\\n73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It\\'s been a heavy day for her.\\n        Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto\\n        his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the\\n        shotgun and starts backing up.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Go!  Run!\\n\\n        Sarah doesn\\'t need to be told twice.\\n        T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power.\\n        Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES.\\n        The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is\\n        filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the\\n        cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.\\n\\n        Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered\\n        by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters\\n        we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a\\n        second.\\n\\n73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,\\n        Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and\\n        John slaps the button for \"Garage Level\".\\n\\n        The doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner.\\n        Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the\\n        T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning.\\n        The rounds hit the steel doors as they close.\\n        T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap.\\n73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that\\n        are punching holes in the other side.\\n\\n73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance\\n        back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second\\n        later.  The elevator hasn\\'t moved yet.  SSWWIKK!\\n\\n73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them\\n        open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches\\n        the muzzle right INTO T-1000\\'s face -- BOOM!!\\n73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000\\'s head blown apart by the blast.  It\\n        is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends.\\n\\n73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart\\n        into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly.\\n        There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its\\n        hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the\\n        doors apart with inhuman strength\\n73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT.\\n        It falls two floors and...\\n\\n74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof.\\n        Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up.\\n        Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling.\\n        BEAT...\\n        Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears\\n        down four feet into the elevator car.\\n        It is inches from Sarah\\'s face.\\n        She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof.\\n        Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing\\n        Terminator\\'s jacket, and missing John by inches.\\n        Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in\\n        the ceiling.\\n        Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal\\n        shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them\\n        slices open her upper arm.\\n\\n75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide\\n        enough.\\n        They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby.\\n\\n        Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the\\n        ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to\\n        life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the\\n        inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!?\\n\\n76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big\\n        enough to...\\n        Pour itself through.\\n        A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops\\n        through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame\\n        as Officer X.\\n\\n        It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after\\n        doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and\\n        sees --\\n\\n77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring\\n        Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the\\n        clutch.\\n        The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the\\n        ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.\\n\\n        Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator.\\n        The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the\\n        back wall of the elevator.\\n        Terminator rolls to his feet.\\n        Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it.\\n        Terminator catches the life flare with one hand.\\n        Levels the shotgun with the other.\\n        With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike\\'s gas tank.\\n        Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000.\\n        Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM!\\n\\n        The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him\\n        in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah\\n        toward the exit ramp.\\n\\n78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital\\n        security car comes screeching down the other way.\\n        Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a\\n        shrieking halt.  She\\'s in the guy\\'s face with the .45 in both hands.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                Out of the car!!\\n\\n        The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round\\n        through the glass next to his head.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                RIGHT NOW!\\n\\n        The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as\\n        Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way\\n        and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and\\n        dives into the front passenger seat as --\\n\\n78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the\\n        tires on the slick ramp.\\n        Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him\\n        to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket\\n        and starts feeding them in.\\n        Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely\\n        in control.  Because...\\n\\n79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below.\\n        This guy won\\'t quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it\\n        runs.\\n        It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining.\\n\\n80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches\\n        it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide.\\n        The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate.\\n        John hands the shot gun back to Terminator.\\n        He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer.\\n        The T-1000\\'s face is right in the headlights.\\n80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal\\n        visible in the hole, which then closes.\\n80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire.\\n        The car crashes backward through the security barricade.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                        (calmly)\\n                Hang on.\\n\\n        He cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping\\n        ends with a screech.\\n        T-1000 is almost on them.\\n        Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward.\\n\\n80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk.\\n        Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid.\\n        Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down,\\n        punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up.\\n        Terminator turns to Sarah.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Drive.\\n\\n        Terminator heaves himself half out the driver\\'s window.  Sarah slaps\\n        her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.\\n\\n80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it\\n        slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and\\n        missing John by inches as he ducks.\\n        It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --\\n\\n80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car.\\n        Fires point-blank.\\n        Hits the T-1000\\'s arm just above the \"hand\" which anchors it to the\\n        car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.\\n\\n80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car.\\n        John looks out the back window, his eyes wide.\\n        He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running.\\n        But he\\'s dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the\\n        liquid-metal killer won\\'t catch them on foot.\\n\\n80G     John watches, in awe, as the \"crowbar hand\", stuck into the trunk\\n        right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of\\n        think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and\\n        falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.\\n\\n80H     The car speeds off into the night.\\n        REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup,\\n        watching the tail lights recede.  It looks down.\\n\\n80I     ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob.  Next to it is the\\n        T-1000\\'s shiny cop shoe.  The mercury blob crawls and rejoins the\\n        main mass, disappearing into the \"shoe\".\\n\\n81      INT./EXT. SECURITY CAR\\n\\n        A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight\\n        highway.  Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in\\n        the wind.\\n\\n81A     INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high.  The air is blowing\\n        in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily by\\n        electronic night-vision.  His eyes glow faintly red.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Can you see anything?\\n\\n81B     TERMINATOR\\'S POV.  A monochrome image of the highway lit bright as\\n        day.\\n\\n81C     Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Everything.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Cool.\\n\\n        Sarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is\\n        happening.

He and John climb in.\\n\\n92A     IN THE PICKUP.  Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if\\n        you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around\\n        a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand.  When it\\n        shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub\\n        of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips.  This starts the vehicle.\\n        It takes about three seconds.\\n\\n        In fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time John\\n        flips down the sun visor.

They keep firing.\\n        The rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps\\n        moving.\\n\\n                                LEADER\\n                You\\'re not hitting him!\\n\\n                                SWAT #1\\n                        (getting scared)\\n                Yes I am!\\n\\n        Terminator draws his .45 smoothly.  Unhurried.  He shoots the nearest\\n        man in the left thigh.  As he screams and drops, Terminator shoots\\n        him in the right thigh.  Terminator bends down and picks up the \\n        shrieking man\\'s weapon... the TEAR-GAS LAUNCHER.\\n\\n        It is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum.\\n        Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas\\n        launcher.  The gas canister hits the guy\\'s body armor and doesn\\'t\\n        penetrate.  But it\\'s like getting slugged in the stomach with a full-\\n        swing from a baseball bat.  The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles,\\n        gasping.\\n\\n        Terminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black\\n        leather, streaked with blood.  One eye is a bloody socket, the metal\\n        eye-servo glistening.  The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters,\\n        revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath.  The whole front of his \\n        jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest.\\n\\n        The remaining SWATs start to fall back.  One turns to run and --\\n        KPOW!  A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling.\\n\\n173F    Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby.  It fills\\n        rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet.  It\\n        is total pandemonium.  SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white-\\n        knuckling the rifle.  Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right\\n        in front of him.  POOM!  Terminator drills him in the leg with the\\n        .45.  As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator\\n        rips his gas mask off.  The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor,\\n        choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh.\\n\\n        Terminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors.  POW-POW.  Leg\\n        and leg.  He snatches their masks as they fall.  The gunfire has\\n        stopped.  Nobody an see anything.  Screams and whimpers echo in the\\n        smoke.\\n\\n174     EXT. BUILDING\\n\\n        Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.  Firing the\\n        tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining\\n        rounds among the cop vehicles.  Unprotected officers run, choking\\n        and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It\\n        is a total rout.\\n\\n175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining\\n        masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside\\n        him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty\\n        launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak\\n        vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.\\n\\n175A    INT. SWAT VAN\\n\\n        Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver\\'s\\n        seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The\\n        keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear.\\n\\n176     INT./EXT. LOBBY\\n\\n        The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are\\n        tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a\\n        roaring engine.\\n\\n176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and\\n        debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a \\n        smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads\\n        to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he\\n        seals the corridor with the back of the van.\\n\\n176B    Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing.\\n        They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle.\\n        The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n177     INT./EXT SECOND FLOOR\\n\\n        T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office\\n        and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining\\n        cops firing at it.  It knows.  It looks around.  Analyzing options.\\n        It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of\\n        this corner office block...\\n        It twists full throttle on the powerful bike.\\n        Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the\\n        windows --\\n\\n178     T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle.  It\\n        rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and --\\n178A    SLAMS into the canopy.  The impact of bike and rider pitches the\\n        chopper radically.  The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the\\n        bike tumbles to the pavement below.\\n178B    The T-1000 doesn\\'t.  It clings to the shattered canopy.\\n        Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head\\n        through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the\\n        jagged hole.  It reforms instantly into its previous self on the\\n        passenger seat.\\n\\n178C    It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver\\'s\\n        seat.\\n        The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.  It drops\\n        toward the parking lot.  T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the\\n        ground.\\n\\n178D    Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by\\n        inches.\\n        The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the\\n        parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.\\n\\n        OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS, HERE IT COMES...\\n\\n179     INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van\\n        onto a divided highway.  Sarah and John are catching their breath,\\n        still coughing from the CS gas.  Terminator look to the rear-view\\n        mirror.  He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them,\\n        gaining.\\n\\n        Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.  It is a rolling\\n        armory.  There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                John, get under these.  Hurry!\\n\\n        He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet-\\n        proof vests on top of him, completely covering him.  Then she grabs\\n        two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.  She starts on a shotgun\\n        as --\\n\\n180     The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed.\\n        Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to\\n        be crawling.  The van hits it top speed of eighty.  They swerve to\\n        miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER.\\n180A    The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.\\n180B    T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine\\n        pistol and FIRES.  The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.  The door\\n        windows are BLOWN IN.\\n\\n        Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000\\'s aim.\\n        The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.\\n        One of the doors is kicked open.  Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest,\\n        crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.  SHE OPENS FIRE.\\n\\n180C    Bullets riddle what\\'s left of the chopper\\'s canopy as the T-1000\\n        returns fire.\\n        The van is stitched with hits.\\n\\n180D    INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls,\\n        ripping up the interior.  The vests covering John are hit repeatedly.\\n        We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back\\n        door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.  She pops\\n        back out and fires in controlled bursts.  The M-16 empties and she\\n        grabs another.\\n\\n180E    Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it\\n        and knocking it skidding.\\n\\n181     OMITTED\\n\\n181A    Sarah reloads and keeps firing.  The van swerves around a Toyota.  A\\n        moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top\\n        of the car.\\n\\n181B    T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.\\n181C    Sarah has popped out to fire.  She takes a HIT in the thigh, and\\n        several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.  She is thrown back onto\\n        the floor of the van.  She lies there, an exposed target...\\n\\n181D    Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.\\n        He locks up the van\\'s brakes.  Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies.\\n        Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.\\n182     And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.\\n        The rotor disintegrates.  The back doors of the van are crushed in as\\n        the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,\\n        trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the\\n        pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a\\n        shapeless mass of twisted metal.\\n        It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.\\n\\n182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently\\n        from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching\\n        along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer\\n        down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP\\n        crawling like a snail ahead.\\n\\n        THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is\\n        sawing into the tire.  The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.\\n        The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,\\n        and the van slides sideways and topples --\\n        STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.\\n\\n182B    INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her\\n        bleeding leg.  She is white and shocky.  Terminator starts to\\n        extricate himself from the crumpled driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n183     BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk\\n        metal, unrecognizable.  Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, \\n        shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.  The big tires lock up in\\n        clouds of tire-smoke.  The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short\\n        of the wrecked chopper.\\n\\n183A    The shaken DRIVER jumps down.\\n        The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.\\n\\n                                DRIVER\\n                Goddamn, are you alri --\\n\\n183B    SSSHHCK!  T-1000 drives a blade through the man\\'s abdomen and walks\\n        on past without slowing, or even looking at him.\\n\\n183C    It climbs into the open cab of the tanker.  Releases the brake.\\n        As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters\\n        on the side which say \"CRYOCO INC.  LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY\\'.\\n\\n184     AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the\\n        wreck.  Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the\\n        bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.  John has\\n        borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.\\n\\n184A    The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.  The DRIVER,\\n        A Hispanic guy in his 50\\'s, is getting out to help them.  Terminator\\n        and John hear a CRASH and look back as the\\n185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.\\n\\n186                             JOHN\\n                Holy shit.

John\\n        runs to the passenger side.\\n\\n187     THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts\\n        up through the gears.\\n\\n188     Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.  The\\n        tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.\\n        Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug\\n        loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.  It accelerates\\n        slowly.\\n\\n189     THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the\\n        way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.  The 18-wheeler shifts\\n        to a higher gear, still accelerating.\\n\\n190     INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK\\n\\n        With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving\\n        the pickup back and forth across the lanes.\\n        The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Faster!  He\\'s right on us!\\n\\n        Terminator doesn\\'t reply.  He rapidly unslings the blooper, still\\n        around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.\\n\\n191     LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens,\\n        filling frame with chrome and lights.\\n\\n191A    K-WHAM!!  It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.\\n\\n191B    Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and\\n        crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.  The spinning\\n        chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail\\n        screeches along the other side.\\n\\n        The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between\\n        the big-rig and the divider\\n        Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel.\\n        Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides.\\n        The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in.\\n        Metal and glass shower in through the side windows.\\n        The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being\\n        shaken right out of his teeth.\\n        The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind\\n        them.\\n\\n191C    INT.

Keeping his foot on the\\n        gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Drive for a minute.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Where you going?!\\n\\n        Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand.\\n        Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its\\n        frame.  It flies over the top of the truck.\\n\\n191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.\\n        He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.\\n191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES\\n        against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid\\n        nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.\\n\\n191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like\\n        a pendulum behind the cab.\\n\\n191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards.\\n        Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen\\n        vapor.  It is gaining again.\\n\\n        Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload.\\n191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.\\n\\n191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the\\n        ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them\\n        and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.\\n\\n191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES.\\n        The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts\\n        out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.\\n\\n191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor\\n        like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back\\n        of the pickup.

There\\'s\\n        nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare\\n        which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.\\n\\n192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup.\\n        He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and --\\n        Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood.\\n192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.\\n        Right into T-1000\\'s face.\\n        The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke\\n        and fire  Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to\\n        SHUDDER AND\\n192C    SCREAM.  IT IS JACK-KNIFING.\\n        Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires\\n        are shrieking over the pavement.  The tractor is smashed back at\\n        right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.\\n\\n192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways\\n        across the pavement.\\n        It begins to topple.\\n        Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top.\\n        With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig\\n        slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks\\n        sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.\\n\\n192E    John sees what\\'s behind him, then snaps around to see the building\\n        looming right in front.

Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o\\n193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230.\\n\\n193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a\\n        stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are\\n        slammed forward, hard.\\n\\n193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across\\n        the floor.\\n        He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a\\n        massive machine.\\n\\n193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and\\n        shudders to a stop.

A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one\\n        elbow to survey the scene.\\n\\n193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from\\n        his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are\\n        sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees\\n        what they are running from...\\n\\n193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is\\n        a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange\\n        light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing\\n        vapor rolls down the center.\\n\\n193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape\\n        of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It\\n        drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen\\n        flows around its feet.\\n\\n194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been\\n        affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it\\n        walks...\\n\\n194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles\\n        forward, and --\\n194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of\\n        its other ankle,\\n194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.  It topples forward to its\\n        knees.\\n        Catches itself on one hand.  Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand.\\n\\n        Now the hand is stuck to the pavement.\\n194D    The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK!

It punches into Terminator\\'s back, through a\\n        gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth,\\n        widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it\\n        down.\\n        It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator\\'s chest.\\n        And into the floor.  He is pinioned.

Children swinging on swings.  Sliding down slides.\\n        Timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will not\\n        change.  As we track we hear:\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                August 29th 1997 came and went.  Nothing much\\n                happened.  Michael Jackson turned forty.  There\\n                was no Judgment Day.  People went to work as\\n                they always do, laughed, complained, watched\\n                TV, made love.\\n\\n        We pass a jungle gym, neither melted nor burned, but full of kids\\n        swinging and yelling raucously.  Past it we drop down to see a boy\\n        pumping the pedals of a tricycle.\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                I wanted to run down the street yelling... to\\n                grab them all and say \"Every day form this day\\n                is a gift.  Use it well!\"  Instead I got drunk.\\n\\n        STILL TRACKING we come to rest on an elderly woman seated on a bench.\\n        It is SARAH, now 64 years old.  The world has aged her, but she seems\\n        at peace in this moment.  She speaks into a microcassette recorder.\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                That was thirty years ago.  But the dark future\\n                which never came still exists for me, and it\\n                always will, like the traces of a dream lingering\\n                in the morning light.  And the war against the\\n                machines goes on.  Or, to be more precise, the\\n                war against those who build the wrong machines.\\n\\n        There is a man in is forties playing with two small children\\n        nearby.  He turns.  It is John Connor.  Through he has the same stern\\n        features in adulthood, there is no eye-patch, no scarring.  He is far\\n        from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might\\n        have been.  But there is still penetrating intelligence, even wisdom,\\n        in his eyes.\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                John fights the war differently than it was\\n                foretold.  Here, on the battlefield of the\\n                Senate, the weapons are common sense... and\\n                hope.\\n\\n        A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL runs to her to have her shoelace tied.\\n\\n                                GIRL\\n                Tie me, grandma.\\n\\n        Grandma Sarah smiles.  It is the only time we have seen her smile so\\n        far.  She bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench.\\n        She ties as we hear:\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                The luxury of hope was given to me by the\\n                Terminator.  Because if a machine can learn\\n                the value of human life... maybe we can too.\\n\\n        Sarah ruffles the kids\\'s hair as she runs off to play with her dad.\\n\\n                                                FADE OUT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day\\nWriters : James CameronWilliam Wisher\\nGenres : Sci-FiActionThrillerDrama\\nUser Comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to IMSDb\\n\\n\\n'"
